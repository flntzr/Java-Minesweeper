I've created a simple lightweight java-based version of minesweeper with the help of a friend and reddit.
Feel free to make any changes (stupid thing to say on github, i know) and ask me if you don't understand parts of my code..

There is lots of room for improvement - those things have yet to be implemented:
- being able to exit full-screen  --> a better resize-handling is necessary
- add a counter for the unflagged bombs
- shorten the response-time
- remove unnecessary comments (especially the ones i made in German)
- add nicer images

Already done in updates:
- implement a windows-minesweeper-like middleclick event

PS: I still don't fully understand the concept of github so please tell me if i did something stupid at some point.
